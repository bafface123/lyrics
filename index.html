<h1>Friday Night Funkin' Horrorland Lyrics i guess
  
Your skin is freezing,

here let me help you take it off.

[Chipmunk noises]
  
Feasting with your friends,

what a perfect way to end,

all these lonely holidays.

(la la la la)

[chipmunk noises]
  
Gonna take a piece of your rabies,

and vivisect your mind.
  
[chipmunk.mp3]

Snowman smiling with your teeth,
  
[chipmunk sound effect #2]

fallen angels created with your meat.

[guess what it is?]
  
(That pearly smile.)
  
[more fucking chipmunk noises]

Cut, in a thousand slices.

Bake you 'til, golden brown.
  
[yup, more chipmunk noises]

Stuff you with spices.

[chipmunk]
  
Serve to friends around.

Separate, you from your eyes.

Turn your girlfriend inside out,

and burn her fingernails.

(la la la la)
  
[chipmonk]

Soak your hands in freezing water.
  
[la ardilla]

Watching as the skin gets softer.
  
[le tamia]

See your bones appear in

dark red snow.

Drop further below.

Gonna take a piece of your rabies,

and vivisect your mind.
  
[champonk]

Gonna take a peek inside your head,
  
[cimunk]

and find the worm inside.

[i think it's chipmunk]
  
Cut, in a thousand slices.

Bake you 'til, golden brown.
  
[chimunk]

Fill you with spices.

[chumpink]
  
Serve to friends around.
  
Turn the heat on high and

we'll reduce your blood,
  
[chumpkink]

boil 'lil boyfriend,
  
[more chinump noises]

with brandy and plums.

[final chimunk sounds]</h1>
